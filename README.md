# Polyhunter
An endless-survival game made using Pygame

DESCRIPTION:
Polyhunter is an endless-survival game made using Pygame. dodge or shoot the polygons as they enter the screen to increase your score. Press arrow key(s) to move, press the space bar + arrow key(s) to shoot.

IMPORTANT:
Ensure that the environment you are running has the Pygame library installed. If using Anaconda, I recommend creating a separate environment for pygame projects. The Pygame library is not available in base Anaconda (last I checked), so you'll have to pip install.
